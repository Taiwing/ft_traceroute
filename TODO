- fix timeout when two hops in a row are 'empty' (search until the first
  valid hop in check pending probes) (or maybe this is because ft_traceroute
  has no fallback whereas system traceroute tries to ping the remote host
  when UDP fails, so maybe do that ?)
- fix time values which are too far away from the original traceroute (this
  is actually bad since the subject says there cannot be more than a 30ms
  difference on a hop). This may be due to an optimization problem, like the
  check_pending_probes loop which takes too much time or somewhere else.
- test the hell out of the options
- oh and do not forget to reset probe size to default 60 bytes, not 1024 bytes
  (maybe handle size like the original, with a command line argument)
