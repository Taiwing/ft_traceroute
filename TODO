- fix timeout when two hops in a row are 'empty' (search until the first
  valid hop in check pending probes) (or maybe this is because ft_traceroute
  has no fallback whereas system traceroute tries to ping the remote host
  when UDP fails, so maybe do that ?)
- test the hell out of the options
- oh and do not forget to reset probe size to default 60 bytes, not 1024 bytes
  (maybe handle size like the original, with a command line argument)
